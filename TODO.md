### Current issue with testing the API's
- Twitter has not sandbox to test the API's functionality, Making calls to the API now and again with every feationality merged is not ideal coupled with the high rate limit Twitter API implement. An Ideas is to maybe create a separate account for testing the API's functionality.
- Open to other means of testing the API's functionality.

## Editing and Marking as Done

- To **mark a task as done**: Change `[ ]` to `[x]` in the list above.
- To **edit a task**: Update the module description or add specific implementation details next to the module name.
